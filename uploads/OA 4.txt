First, I'm going to talk about my good meal. Last Sunday, I went to a Mexican restaurant with my friend. It was not expensive, and I paid. I had tacos and a glass of lemonade. It was delicious.

Now I'm going to talk about my bad meal. Two weeks ago, I went to a fast-food restaurant with my brother. It was a very bad meal. We had burgers and soda. The burgers were cold, and the soda was flat. It was terrible.

Last weekend, I went to a Peruvian restaurant. I drank a glass of chicha morada. I ate ceviche and lomo saltado. The food was amazing. I really liked the ceviche because it was very fresh. The restaurant was cozy and the staff were friendly. It wasn't too expensive. I had a great time!
